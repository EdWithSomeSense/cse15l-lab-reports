#Week 2 Lab Report
Welcome and congradulations on making into the third week of the CSE 15L course. Today, I, your instructor, will show you the way on how to \
1.)  Create a server that adds strings and prints it on top of itself \
2.) Talk about bugs that have happened during the Lab Session today, and how you could possibly fix it. \
3.) Talk about things that was new overall. 

Are you ready? If so, lets get down to it!

## Part 1 - creating the site
So during week two of the CSE 15L course, we learned about how to make a server during our lab session. This material is very essential in the overall creation of our server. /
Head to the [wavelet github](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/wavelet) and download it onto your computer. \

Honestly speaking, you will not need the NumberServer.java since you will be recreating something else known as StringServer. \
Create a new file in the same folder called StringServer and import the following. 
```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;
import java.util.ArrayList;
```

By importing those, we can create ArrayList within the code that can be printed on the server/website.
